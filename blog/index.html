    </body>maybe i can make some posts through my website. im not good at all with programming yet but thats alr ig. im trying to put myself out there a bit more now that im actually able to start new with college. i doubt id really update this often, i rarely am consistant with anything, but i can hope and believe that i will keep adding to this site. this code is sloppy and fucked like any other project that ive made but it functions. </body>

    </body>jesus christ how has it already almost been a month. im in college now and tried to switch my schedule to make it less spread out. oh well, i at least have a 3 day weekend! always look at the positives ig lmaoooo.. not excited to retake calc 1 either but ill manage. ive already made a lot of friends and its been nice exploring campus and being social. im not used to it for sure, but its nice and it feels like home, so thats what matters i suppose.</body>
