    <h3>INSPIRATION</h3>
    <body>
      destiny was an accumulation of many ideas but the main two were from the loss of my best friend and the album Odyssey by HOME.

    <h3>STORY</h3>
    <p>
      in destiny, i tried to retell the story of how i found out about losing my friend. of course, its not 100% accurate
      but i aimed to give a clear cut story with little room for interpretation. i doubt anyone really thought about it
      too much deeper, but thats not their fault. 
    </p>
    <p>
      the track "This" ends with a phone call that gets ignored. at the end of the track "Is", you can clearly hear a 
      phone ringtone, footsteps on concrete, a shotgun being pumped, then a gunshot with blood sounds. "Fate" has an 
      ambulance and a sfx saying no, in response to the ambulance and the phone call not being picked up.
    </p>
    <h3>PRE-RELEASE</h3>
    <p>
      when producing the first three tracks, i produced them all in one session at 1 in the morning. so initially, destiny was just 
      going to be, "This" "Is" "Fate". eventually, i decided to extend the project to add more songs to the ep. retrospectively,
      i should have just kept destiny 3 songs. "Unless" and "You" were just inserted after with no real connection to the overall meaning 
      of the ep. "Change" has these voices that are all around and whispering as this annoying pluck is played. its supposed to make you
      uncomfortable by design, and i think i nailed it. this was a representation of "the voice" that is in my head that always spews out
      negative thoughts. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
    at the time of this album, i was starting to take medications to help my ocd and depression. even though it had been two years since
    my friend took his own life, i struggled to cope with it. it is something that will never leave me. this ep was a way i attempted to
    come to terms with the situation i was in.
