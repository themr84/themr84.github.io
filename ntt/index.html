    <pre>
1. to activate windows, use in PowerShell:

<code>irm https://massgrave.dev/get | iex </code>


2. rutracker.org has a lot of useful torrents and shit. 
prioritize using it over any other site.


3. for visiting any foreign website, use a real-time 
text translator extension.


4. monkrus.ws has all of adobe’s shit, use this instead 
of rutracker. this is the only exclusion of tip 2.


5. for pirating most software, add a firewall exclusion 
in the windows firewall (or your anti-virus 
software).


6. to get some more information on someone, using a 
relative’s name, use truepeoplesearch.com.


7. learning how to type and learning key binds are a 
major advantage when using a computer.


8. when learning something, avoid following tutorials 
and focus on understanding the concepts instead of 
making a one-to-one clone of the tutorial.


9. data-hoarding is most effective when only 
occasionally using a disk.


10. google is your friend.


11. add the word reddit after searching for something; 
results will then come from reddit. redditors 
usually have the same and obscure issues as you, so 
make sure to check there before anywhere else.


12. do not trust tik-tok or temu. both are spyware.


13. limit personalization settings within any accounts 
you may have along with deleting data stored by 
companies (excl. sites or accounts that hold 
important or cherished data, such as photos).


14. if buying isn’t owning, piracy isn’t stealing is a 
common phrase used; it references the idea that 
digital content can be revoked even if you bought 
it. instead of owning it digitally, you basically 
only bought access to it. in theory, if you can’t 
own something you bought, you might as well save 
your money and pirate it.


15. purchasing a vpn service is required to pirate 
safely. your internet provider will fine you for 
each offense.


16. when pirating, check the megathread on r/piracy.


17. ensure digital cleaning happens yearly; delete old 
apps, software, photos, documents, etc. obviously 
exclude important or sedimental ones.


18. when trying to focus on something, listen to 
electronic/jazz/instrumentals. helps by not having 
lyrics interfere with your thoughts.


19. save your documents often.


20. learn how to use ctrl+c, ctrl+v, ctrl+s, and ctrl+z 
(copy, paste, save, and undo).


21. depending on the program, redo tends to be either 
ctrl+shift+z or ctrl+y.


22. if something seems too good, it probably is.


23. with the rise of ai, critical thinking is more 
important than ever.


24. don’t narrow yourself into one way of seeing a 
topic. keeping an open mind is key to understanding 
and empathy, along with being critical to understand 
media.


25. minimize usage of snapchat and prefer to use the 
default messaging app.


26. like any other new technology, ai is controversial. 
the issue is being able to understand, regulate, and 
counter the issues of ai. 


27. ai can never be an artist. art is a form of 
expression. ai cannot express and cannot create 
original pieces without a reference.


28. reference does not equate to skill


29. apple does not care about its customers


30. iphones are only secure because of the number of 
restrictions.


31. restrictions do not guarantee security.


32. most security issues for the average user are 
within data usage and data selling, not viruses or 
malware.


33. don’t use facebook, its mind rot for old people.


34. if it exists, there’s porn of it.


35. over-the-head headphones will usually be more 
comfortable and have better sound quality than 
earbuds.


36. noise-cancelation works by taking audio from a 
microphone input and inverting it to cancel it out 
in real-time processing.


37. latency is the delay between inputs or actions.


38. any game running below 30 fps is not playable. 
anything running under 60 fps is acceptable.


39. high average fps does not translate to feeling well 
if your lows of fps are bad.


40. the term of 1% lows references the idea of fps and 
the very worst of the fps. depending on the gap 
between the lows and average fps, the smoothness of 
the content can change.


41. 1% lows should be as close to your average as 
possible. the closer the less of a stuttering feel.


42. having fun is the best way to learn something with 
technology.


43. technology is very adaptable and can be used in 
lots of ways that you might not think of.


44. technologies will replace jobs but bring in new 
jobs as well.


45. importance of computer parts is as follows (in my 
opinion): 
 

gpu > cpu > power-supply > ram > storage > 
motherboard > peripherals > case

your gpu and cpu determine the speeds of games and 
programs, your power supply supplies power, your ram 
is short-term storage for programs to quickly 
access, your storage manages data, and your 
motherboard connects all your components together. 
your peripherals include your monitor, mouse, 
keyboard, and any other device that is plugged in. 
your case houses all of your components. this order 
can change depending on what you need your pc to do. 


46. androids aren’t as bad as they used to be.


47. console and phone wars are pointless debates. all 
sides need to agree that separation is making things 
more annoying and divisive.


48. apple music is better than spotify, other than 
recommendations. 


49. open-source programs are programs that have their 
code and assets fully open to the public, which can 
be forked.


50. forks are modifications of a project by a new 
person or group.


51. closed-source programs are programs that do not 
have their code and assets open to the public.


52. virtual machines, or vms, are programs that act as 
a computer on your computer. computer- inception!


53. avoid buying cheap technology to avoid adding to 
the e-waste issues.


54. there’s always a way to break software. the only 
issue is time.


55. the term jailbreaking refers to the act of rooting 
an iphone, or allowing the user to control anything 
about their iphone.


56. side-loading should be allowed for all ios users.


57. technology is expensive and will more than likely 
always stay expensive.


58. decapitalization and corporate greed are killing 
innovation.


59. children should not be allowed to use the internet 
without constant supervision until the age of 13.


60. parents are the issues with gen alpha due to not 
enough moderation of technology.


61. technology cannot raise your kids single-handedly.


62. ethernet is wired wifi, which makes the connections 
more stable and hastier.


63. video games can be educational whether it was 
intended to be or not.


64. virtual and augmented reality will be major players 
in tech within the near the future.


65. crypto-currencies will fall more and more.


66. invest in stocks instead of crypto.


67. invest in tech company stocks before big 
announcements happen


68. tech company stocks are usually always on the rise.


69. 


70. giving up is always easier than actually doing the 
thing you are giving up.


71. giving up is for pussies. don't give up.


72. ocd pushes your personal expectations to 
unachievable levels.
